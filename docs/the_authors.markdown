was an American economist and long-time professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He taught at the University of Chicago from 1955 to 1960, and thereafter at UCLA until 2001. Professor Hirshleifer was well known for his work on uncertainty and information in economics, the economic analysis of conflict, and bioeconomics. His undergraduate textbook, [Price Theory and Applications](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/microeconomics/price-theory-and-applications-decisions-markets-and-information-7th-edition?format=PB), went into seven editions. A 1958 article by Hirshleifer began the triumphant comeback of Irving Fisher theory of capital and interest, now deemed canonical.
